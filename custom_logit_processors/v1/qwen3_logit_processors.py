    msg = """Bob is an avid fan of the video game \"League of Leesins\", and today he celebrates as the League of Leesins World Championship comes to an end! \n\nThe tournament consisted of $n$ ($n \\ge 5$) teams around the world. Before the tournament starts, Bob has made a prediction of the rankings of each team, from $1$-st to $n$-th. After the final, he compared the prediction with the actual result and found out that the $i$-th team according to his prediction ended up at the $p_i$-th position ($1 \\le p_i \\le n$, all $p_i$ are unique). In other words, $p$ is a permutation of $1, 2, \\dots, n$.\n\nAs Bob's favorite League player is the famous \"3ga\", he decided to write down every $3$ consecutive elements of the permutation $p$. Formally, Bob created an array $q$ of $n-2$ triples, where $q_i = (p_i, p_{i+1}, p_{i+2})$ for each $1 \\le i \\le n-2$. Bob was very proud of his array, so he showed it to his friend Alice.\n\nAfter learning of Bob's array, Alice declared that she could retrieve the permutation $p$ even if Bob rearranges the elements of $q$ and the elements within each triple. Of course, Bob did not believe in such magic, so he did just the same as above to see Alice's respond.\n\nFor example, if $n = 5$ and $p = [1, 4, 2, 3, 5]$, then the original array $q$ will be $[(1, 4, 2), (4, 2, 3), (2, 3, 5)]$. Bob can then rearrange the numbers within each triple and the positions of the triples to get $[(4, 3, 2), (2, 3, 5), (4, 1, 2)]$. Note that $[(1, 4, 2), (4, 2, 2), (3, 3, 5)]$ is not a valid rearrangement of $q$, as Bob is not allowed to swap numbers belong to different triples.\n\nAs Alice's friend, you know for sure that Alice was just trying to show off, so you decided to save her some face by giving her any permutation $p$ that is consistent with the array $q$ she was given. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($5 \\le n \\le 10^5$) — the size of permutation $p$.\n\nThe $i$-th of the next $n-2$ lines contains $3$ integers $q_{i, 1}$, $q_{i, 2}$, $q_{i, 3}$ ($1 \\le q_{i, j} \\le n$) — the elements of the $i$-th triple of the rearranged (shuffled) array $q_i$, in random order. Remember, that the numbers within each triple can be rearranged and also the positions of the triples can be rearranged.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there is at least one permutation $p$ that is consistent with the input. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $n$ distinct integers $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ ($1 \\le p_i \\le n$) such that $p$ is consistent with array $q$. \n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any. \n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n5\n4 3 2\n2 3 5\n4 1 2\n\nOutput\n1 4 2 3 5\n\n\nRead the inputs from stdin solve the problem and write the answer to stdout (do not directly test on the sample inputs). Enclose your code within delimiters as follows. Ensure that when the python program runs, it reads the inputs, runs the algorithm and writes output to STDOUT.\n```python\n# YOUR CODE HERE\n```"""
